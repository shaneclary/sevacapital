Creating an **SDG-aligned bond** for Seva’s eye-care scale-up is a **six-stage, ICMA-compliant process**.  
Below is a *decision-ready* roadmap that mirrors best-practice sovereign and supranational issuances (AFD, World Bank, UNDP) while being right-sized for a global NGO or special-purpose vehicle (SPV).

---

### 1. Pre-Issuance Feasibility Gate  
| Checkpoint | Seva-Specific Evidence Required |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| **Clear SDG alignment** | Map every projected cataract surgery / vision centre to **SDG 3 (Good Health)**, **SDG 1 (No Poverty)**, **SDG 4 (Quality Education)** and **SDG 8 (Decent Work)** . |
| **Investable pipeline** | ≥ 3 years of **bankable projects**: 200 VCs, 1 M surgeries, AI-diagnostic roll-out; all with **ex-ante cost-benefit** showing ≥ 36:1 ROI. |
| **Impact KPIs** | **Volume**: surgeries, VCs, screenings; **Equity**: % female, % rural, % bottom-40 income; **Productivity**: wage-gain years restored; **Planet**: tCO₂e avoided (tele-medicine trips saved). |
| **Debt-sustainability** | Model **bond service cover ratio (DSCR)** ≥ 1.25 under stress scenarios; stress-test FX if issued in EUR/USD but assets in INR, GHS, etc. . |
| **Institutional capacity** | Create **“Capital for Seva” SPV** with segregated treasury, ring-fenced proceeds account, independent trustee (e.g., Deutsche Bank, Citi). |

---

### 2. Framework Design (Use-of-Proceeds Bond)  
1. **Bond Type**: *Social/Sustainability Bond* under **ICMA 2023 Principles** .  
2. **Use-of-Proceeds Categories** (eligible assets):  
   - Construction / equipping of **Vision Centres** (≤ $100 k each).  
   - **Cataract surgical equipment** & consumables (IOLs, microscopes).  
   - **AI diagnostic platforms** & mobile surgical units.  
   - **Training scholarships** for ophthalmic staff (≤ $5 k per trainee).  
3. **Green-/Social- screen**: Apply **“Do No Significant Harm” (DNSH)** lens—exclude any project tied to child labour, fossil-fuel transport, or non-renewable energy .  
4. **Minimum allocation timeline**: 12 months from closing; temporary proceeds parked in **EU Taxonomy-aligned green cash funds** .  

---

### 3. Independent External Review  
- **Second-Party Opinion (SPO)**: Sustainalytics / Moody’s ESG / ISS-ESG.  
- **Scope**: Framework alignment with ICMA, KPI materiality, impact-risk assessment.  
- **Cost**: ~ $80–150 k; timeline 6–8 weeks.  
- **Output**: Public SPO report → investor confidence & “greenium” potential .  

---

### 4. Documentation & Structuring  
| Document | Key Content |
|----------|-------------|
| **Offering Circular** | Use-of-proceeds categories, KPI definition, allocation & impact reporting calendar, bond terms (maturity 5–10 yr, fixed coupon, senior unsecured). |
| **Bond Indenture** | Trustee duties, event-of-default covenants, **failure-to-allocate remedy** (interest step-up 25 bps if < 95 % allocated within 24 months) . |
| **KPI Schedule** | *Annual* disclosure: number of surgeries, VCs, glasses dispensed, DALYs averted, wage-gain USD, gender split. |
| **Legal opinion** | English / New York law (if USD); include **negative assurance** on ICMA compliance. |

---

### 5. Marketing & Distribution  
- **Investor Road-Show**: ESG-focused asset managers (BlackRock, PIMCO, Amundi), sovereign wealth funds (ADIA, Norges), development banks (IFC, Proparco).  
- **Format**: Hybrid *144-A / Reg-S* for US & offshore; minimum denomination $200 k to stay within institutional bucket.  
- **Pricing Target**: **5–10 bps inside Seva’s conventional curve** (“greenium”)—validated by AFD & Uruguay issuances .  
- **Book-runners**: Citi, J.P. Morgan, BNP Paribas (green-bond league leaders).  

---

### 6. Post-Issuance Obligations  
| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Annual Allocation Report** | 12 months after closing → disclose % proceeds allocated, unallocated balance, temporary investment holdings. |
| **Annual Impact Report** | KPI table + third-party assured narrative (assurance by PwC / EY ~ $40 k). |
| **Investor Webinar** | Q&A on impact data; publish raw data on **Seva SDG Bond Portal** (open dashboard). |
| **Replacement Assets** | If any project is cancelled / no longer eligible, **substitute within 24 months** or redeem pari passu. |

---

### Illustrative KPI Dashboard (investor-facing)  
| KPI | 2026 Target | SDG Link | Metric Type |
|-----|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Cataract surgeries funded | 1 000 000 | SDG 3 | Output |
| Vision Centres built | 200 | SDG 3, 9 | Output |
| DALYs averted | 3.2 million | SDG 3 | Outcome |
| Wage-gain restored (USD) | $3.6 billion | SDG 1, 8 | Impact |
| Female beneficiaries | ≥ 50 % | SDG 5 | Equity |
| GHG avoided (tCO₂e) | 12 000 | SDG 13 | Co-benefit |

---

### Cost & Timeline Snapshot  
| Milestone | Cost | Week |
|-----------|------|------|
| Framework drafting + SPO | $150 k | 0–8 |
| Legal & listing fees | $300 k | 6–12 |
| Road-show & book-build | $200 k | 10–14 |
| **Total issuance cost** | **~ 25–30 bps of notional** | 14–16 |

---

### Fast-Track Option for Seva  
1. **Partner with a AAA-rated supranational** (e.g., IFC, AFD) to **co-issue**—instant rating uplift & liquidity.  
2. **Use securitisation**: bundle **receivables** from paying VC patients + **results-based contracts** with ministries → **asset-backed SDG bond** (lower coupon).  
3. **Tokenise tranches** on a permissioned blockchain → **24/7 secondary liquidity**, fractional ESG access for retail.

---

**Bottom line**: follow the **ICMA cookbook**, **embed rigorous KPIs**, **secure an SPO early**, and **treat reporting like a public API**—then the **SDG bond becomes a repeatable capital engine** that can **scale Seva to the $1 T impact tier** while giving investors **verifiable, audited impact alpha**.
